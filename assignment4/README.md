Build Your Own Image

* Dockerfiles are part process workflow and part art
* Take existing Node.js and Dockerize it
* Make Dockerfile. Build it. Test it. Push it. (rm it). Run it.
* Expect this to be iterative. Rarely do I get it right the first time
* Details in dockerfile_assignment-1/Dockerfile
* Use the Alpine version of the official 'node' 6.x image
* Expected result is web site at http://localhost
* Tag and push to your Docker Hub account (free)
* Remove your image from local cache, run again from Hub
